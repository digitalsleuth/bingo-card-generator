## Options  

There are many options available:

### Choose a custom logo to use as a dauber  
- when chosen, a JPG or PNG must be supplied, and it will be convered to 48x48  
- for best results, it should be square to begin with  

### Allow the player to choose their own dauber during play  
- when allowed, the player can choose their own digital dauber for each game  
- cannot be changed after selected during gameplay, to avoid confusion  
- once card is "cleared", a new dauber can be chosen  
- option to allow, not allow can be defined prior to card generation  
  
### Allows the generator of the card to choose the card colour and, if applicable, the dauber colour  
- depending on the dauber, the colour can be chosen, but some daubers cannot be changed  
- the circle, square, maple leaf, and heart can be colour-adjusted  
  
### Generates a spreadsheet to track all numbers called, and which cards actually have those numbers  
- gives the ability to confirm an actual "BINGO" quickly, by selecting the card number and visually identifying the "shape"
- when numbers are called, type them into the "CALL" sheet, and they will highlight on each card number  
  
### Easy mode: When selected from the Mode menu, will make 'daubbing' your numbers easier
- In Easy Mode, if B4 is called, clicking on it once on one card will select it for all cards  
- When not selected, if B4 is called, you will have to select it on each card manually  

### Toggle the dauber
- Click the wrong number? Click it again to remove the dauber!
